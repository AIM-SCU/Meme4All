# Meme4All
We present a novel approach to cross-cultural meme transcreation using vision-language
models (VLMs), focusing on the preservation of communicative intent while adapting
cul- tural references for target audiences. Our three-stage hybrid transcreation pipeline
leverages a specialized VLM, LLaVA 1.6, for analysis and caption generation, in con-
junction with the FLUX.1 Schnell model for culturally-adapted visual templates, to trans-
form memes across Chinese and American cultural contexts.

Unlike traditional translation
approaches, our method strategically preserves universal meme formats while replacing
culture-specific elements, maintaining humor and relatability. Through a comprehensive
evaluation involving both human assessors and automated metrics, we demonstrate that
prompt-engineered VLMs with optimized parameters performed well in cultural authentic-
ity and intent preservation. 

Our contributions include: (1) a systematic framework for hy-
brid meme transcreation, (2) bidirectional evaluation across four diverse cultural contexts,
and (3) novel insights into the universal versus culture-specific expression patterns in mul-
timodal humor.
